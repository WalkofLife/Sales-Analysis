Sales Analysis of Electronic Store data of 12 months using Pandas and Matplotlib

Objective: Analyse and answer business questions about 12 months worth of sales data.

Dataset: The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronic store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

Data Exploration:
Once the data has been cleaned a bit, have moved to Data Exploration section. In this section I have explored 5 High level Business Questions related to the dataset:
  1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
  2. What city sold the most product?
  3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying the product?
  4. What products are most often sold together?
  5. What product is sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
